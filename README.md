# RViglione_Website-SitioWeb
This repository consists of my Flask project for my website. It contains the main Python/Flask file, as well as HTML templates, CSS sheets, and static files for the different pages. I will be updating this frequently. 

The file is originally hosted using PythonAnywhere.com, but the domain I purchased is from IONOS. The CNAME file points IONOS to the domain, which is www.RyanViglione.net

As of Tuesday,  November 2nd, the website is live at www.RyanViglione.net

This website will be updated frequently for the dual purpose of general updates, as well as a passion project to help further my knowledge of Python/Flask, HTML, CSS, and general programming.

Thank you/Gracias.
